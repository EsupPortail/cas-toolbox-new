	| deployerConfigContext.xml centralizes into one file some of the declarative configuration that
	| all CAS deployers will need to modify.
	|
	| This file declares some of the Spring-managed JavaBeans that make up a CAS deployment.  
	| The beans declared in this file are instantiated at context initialization time by the Spring 
	| ContextLoaderListener declared in web.xml.  It finds this file because this
	| file is among those declared in the context parameter "contextConfigLocation".
	|
	| By far the most common change you will need to make in this file is to change the last bean
	| declaration to replace the default SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticationHandler with
	| one implementing your approach for authenticating usernames and passwords.
